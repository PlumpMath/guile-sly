@section Textures

Textures are images loaded in graphics memory. Sly supports many
texture formats via the FreeImage library. A texture object can
describe a full image or a rectangular section of an image.

@anchor{2d texture make-texture}@defun make-texture id parent width height s1 t1 s2 t2
Create a new texture object.  ID is the OpenGL texture id.  PARENT is a
texture object (if this texture only represents a region of another
texture) or #f.  WIDTH and HEIGHT are the texture dimensions in pixels.
S1, T1, S2, and T2 are the OpenGL texture coordinates representing the
area of the texture that will be rendered.

@anchor{2d texture make-texture-region}@defun make-texture-region texture x y width height
Creates new texture region object.  TEXTURE is the region's parent
texture.  X, Y, WIDTH, and HEIGHT represent the region of the texture
that will be rendered, in pixels.
