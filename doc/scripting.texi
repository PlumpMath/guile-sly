@chapter Scripting

The ability to write scripts is very important for most games. Scripts
are short programs that modify game state. In an RPG, one might want
to write a script that causes an NPC to walk up to the player and
begin a conversation with them. Sly allows for easy, linear
script writing by using cooperative multitasking, also known as
coroutines. Agendas are used to schedule scripts to be run at distinct
points in game time, and actions provide an API to describe
transformations that happen over a period of game time.
