* Installation Instructions

  Installing guile-2d is rather easy (but not easy enough) if you are
  on a GNU/Linux system. Currently, only installation instructions for
  Debian are provided, but the non-apt commands should work without
  any modifications on any GNU/Linux distro.

  This installation guide assumes that you have the GNU build system
  (automake, autoconf, texinfo, pkg-config) and git installed.

** Install dependencies

*** Guile

    *Debian*

    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      sudo apt-get install guile-2.0-dev
    #+END_SRC

    This assumes that the version of Debian you are running has Guile
    2.0.9.

    Check the versions available to you with =sudo apt-cache show guile-2.0-dev=.

*** SDL
    SDL is a very popular, cross-platform game library.

    *Debian*

     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev
     #+END_SRC

*** Freeimage

    Freeimage is to used to load textures. Make sure that your distro
    provides at least version 3.14.

    *Debian*

    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      sudo apt-get install libfreeimage-dev
    #+END_SRC

*** guile-sdl

    guile-sdl is the GNU Guile wrapper for SDL.

    Grab the latest release tarball from http://www.gnu.org/software/guile-sdl/.

    *Source*

    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      tar xf guile-sdl-<version>.tar.xz
      cd guile-sdl-<version>/
      ./configure --prefix=/usr
      make
      sudo make install
    #+END_SRC

    Note: guile-sdl is currently broken on OS X. Please see this issue
    for more information:
    https://github.com/davexunit/guile-2d/issues/2

*** guile-figl

    *Source*

    FIGL is an unreleased library. You can find an unofficial
    source tarball that is compatible with guile-2d here:
    http://dthompson.us/static/src/guile-figl.tar.gz

    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      tar -xvf guile-figl.tar.gz
      cd guile-figl/
      ./configure --prefix=/usr
      make
      sudo make install
    #+END_SRC

    *Git*

    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      git clone https://gitorious.org/guile-figl/guile-figl.git
      cd guile-figl
      autoreconf -vif
      ./configure --prefix=/usr
      make
      sudo make install
    #+END_SRC

    You will probably encounter a syntax error in the
    /low-level-gl.texi/ file. To fix it, you will need to join the
    lines 19152 and 19153 together. There are a lot of warnings that
    get output, but only one fatal error. The documentation is
    auto-generated from the OpenGL docs and it seems that there are
    still a few bugs in the generator.

** Install guile-2d

   Once the dependencies have been installed, installing guile-2d is
   pretty straightforward.

   *Debian*

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     git clone https://github.com/davexunit/guile-2d.git
     cd guile-2d/
     ./autogen.sh
     ./configure --prefix=/usr
     make
     sudo make install
   #+END_SRC
